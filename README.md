#Item Collage

##Usage

Simply launch the program, point to an item in Diablo 3 and press F1. The item popup is automatically detected, cropped and captured.

Clicking on the item image will remove the last image taken (a.k.a. *undo*).

The *collage* button will create a numbered layout of all captured items and save it to your *Pictures* folder.

##Code

Better not look at it, it's horrible right now.
