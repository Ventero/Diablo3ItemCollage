#Item Collage

##Usage

Simply launch the program, point to an item in Diablo 3 and press F1. The item popup should be automatically detected, cropped and captured.

Clicking on the item image will remove the last image taken (a.k.a. *undo*).

The *collage* button will create a numbered layout of all captured items and save it in your *Pictures* folder.

##Code

Better not look at it, it's horrible right now.

##Known issues (but report them anyway)

* This has been tested for 1680×1050 and 1920×1080 resolutions. It might not work on smaller resolutions (untested as of now).
* The item grabbing doesn't work very reliable in own auctions. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. Inventory, worn items and chest should work fine, though.
